    ## TMF API Reference: TMF 678 - Customer bill Management

    The TMForum CustomerBill Management API allows to retrieve the appliedCustomerBillingRate-objects. 
    It does not specify any creation of such objects, since it expects them to be created by the billing-application 
    itself. In order to be used as part of a microservice architecture, additional create and update methods are provided
    here as an extension.
