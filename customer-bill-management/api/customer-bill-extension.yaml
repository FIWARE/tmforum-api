    ## TMF API Reference: TMF 678 - Customer bill Management

    The TMForum CustomerBill Management API allows to retrieve the appliedCustomerBillingRate-objects. 
    It does not specify any creation of such objects, since it expects them to be created by the billing-application 
    itself. In order to be used as part of a microservice architecture, additional create and update methods are provided
    here as an extension.

    CustomerBill:
      type: object
      description: |-
        The billing account receives all charges (recurring, one time and usage) of the offers and products assigned to it during order process. Periodically according to billing cycle specifications attached to the billing account or as a result of an event, a customer bill (aka invoice) is produced. This customer bill concerns different related parties which play a role on it : for example, a customer bill is produced by an operator, is sent to a bill receiver and has to be paid by a payer.
        A payment method could be assigned to the customer bill to build the call of payment. Lettering process enables to assign automatically or manually incoming amount from payments to customer bills (payment items).
        A tax item is created for each tax rate used in the customer bill.
        The financial account represents a financial entity which records all customer’s accounting events : payment amount are recorded as credit and invoices amount are recorded as debit. It gives the customer overall balance (account balance).
        The customer bill is linked to one or more documents that can be downloaded via a provided url.
